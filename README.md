Tread (Where is My Car)
=====
Tread is an Android application that helps you keep track of all visited places since the start of the app.

At first, it was built to find the location of the last place where the user parked his/her car. But it got optimized
to save all visited locations by the user.

The visited places coordinates are saved and can be displayed anytime in a Google Map.

The accelerometer of the Android phone is used to keep track of the motion of the user.

The GPS locator is used to get the location of any place that is marked to be visited.

Google Maps is loaded to display the map and pinpoint all the locations visited.
